Feel free to delete this file if sourcecode is to your liking.

I've taken several liberties to modify source to be hopefully
more readable and runtime efficient.  This should document the
important highlights.



*Using i instead of index as variable name for indexes just to
save space.

*When indexing up to some count of a list/container, am grabbing
the count member variable up front to avoid listObject.Count
overhead per loop iteration.  Encourages odds it'll be stored in
CPU register and helps guarentee to compiler that we don't care 
about other threads potentially messing with it.  Since we've a
local copy free from potential race conditions.
```x86asm
mov ecx, [listObjectCountAddr] ;mind the memory access overhead
cmp eax, ecx
jl loopBody
;vs
cmp eax, ecx
jl loopBody
```

*Used private access specifier when posible to help understanding
of API design.

*Created a new custom file extenion for clas/method definitions
called .csd.  An unparsed alternaive to partial methods.  Helps
overview an API without code bodies getting in the way.  If the
top level of an API is altered thesse files must be manually
maintained.  To view them more easily in VS, go to
tools->options->text editor->file extenssions, and add your own
file csd file extension with the syntax of Microsoft Viual C#.
